## âœ… Assessment_Q1.sql â€” High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

### Objective:
Identify customers who have both a funded **savings plan** and a funded **investment plan**, and calculate their total deposits.

### Approach:
- Classified savings plans using `is_regular_savings = 1` and investment plans using `is_a_fund = 1`.
- Aggregated deposit amounts (`confirmed_amount`) from `savings_savingsaccount` and linked plans via `plan_id`.
- Counted the number of savings and investment plans per customer and calculated total deposits.
- Converted amounts from **kobo to naira** and **rounded to 2 decimal places**.
- Filtered customers with **at least one** savings and **one** investment plan.
- Sorted by total deposit value.

### Challenges:
- Ensured correct classification of plans.
- Used conditional aggregation and distinct counts to avoid duplication.
- Maintained financial formatting standards with proper conversion and rounding.

## âœ… Assessment_Q2.sql â€” Transaction Frequency Analysis

### Objective:
Segment customers based on their **average number of transactions per month**, and categorize them as:

- **High Frequency** (â‰¥10/month)
- **Medium Frequency** (3â€“9/month)
- **Low Frequency** (â‰¤2/month)

### Approach:
- Counted transactions per user and measured tenure in months using `TIMESTAMPDIFF` between first and last transaction.
- Enforced a **minimum tenure of 1 month**.
- Calculated `avg_transactions_per_month`, rounded to 2 decimal places.
- Used a `CASE` statement to assign frequency categories.
- Grouped by category to compute the number of customers and average frequency per group.

### Challenges:
- Protected against divide-by-zero errors for short-tenure accounts.
- Excluded null transaction dates.
- Ordered frequency categories logically (High â†’ Medium â†’ Low).

## âœ… Assessment_Q3.sql â€” Account Inactivity Alert

### Objective:
Identify active **savings** or **investment** plans with **no inflow transactions in the last 365 days**.

### Approach:
- Defined active plans as: `is_archived = 0`, `is_deleted = 0`, `is_deleted_from_group = 0`.
- Used `MAX(transaction_date)` to determine the last transaction per plan.
- Classified each plan by type (`Savings` or `Investment`) using flags.
- Calculated `inactivity_days` as the number of days since the last transaction.
- Filtered for `inactivity_days > 365`.

### Challenges:
- Accounted for plans with no recent activity while ensuring historical activity existed.
- Used date difference logic (`DATEDIFF`) for precision.

## âœ… Assessment_Q4.sql â€” Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

### Objective:
Estimate **Customer Lifetime Value** using the formula:


Where:
- `avg_profit_per_transaction = 0.1% of transaction value`

### Approach:
- Counted transactions and summed transaction value per user.
- Calculated tenure in months from `date_joined` to `CURRENT_DATE`, using `GREATEST(..., 1)` for robustness.
- Computed `estimated_clv` using the provided formula, with all values converted from **kobo to naira** and **rounded to 2 decimal places**.
- Sorted users by estimated CLV.

### Challenges:
- Ensured accurate unit conversion and rounding.
- Handled low-tenure customers to avoid skewed calculations.

## âœ… How to Run

You can run each SQL file independently against a MySQL-compatible database schema that contains the following tables:

- `users_customuser`
- `plans_plan`
- `savings_savingsaccount`
- `withdrawals_withdrawal`

Ensure the schema is populated and relationships are respected before executing the queries.
